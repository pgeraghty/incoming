Thank you for helping improve Incoming.

We especially want reports of:
- Protocol edge cases
- Malformed inputs that cause crashes
- Interop problems with real SMTP clients

Please include in issues:
- Steps to reproduce
- Raw SMTP session (if possible)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs or stack traces
